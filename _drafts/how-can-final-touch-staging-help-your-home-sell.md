Today I have the honor of visiting with Rachael Borland with Final Touches Staging. She’s been in business for the last seven years and she’s been a great ally ever since.

Last year, Rachael did about 80 full stagings. **Out of those 80, 70% of them were sold within one month, and 90% were sold within two.&nbsp;**

Before you stage anything else, Rachael recommends that you stage the living room, Then move onto the master bathroom, dining room, and kitchen, in that order. **That’s where you want to focus your efforts first.**

Home Staging Resource did a survey of 4,200 staged homes last year. Of those homes, 85% sold for 6% to 25% more than neighboring homes that were for sale at the same time. **In a $300,000 house, for example, that means almost $20,000 more on your sale.** Spending $1,000 over a few months to stage your home is a small piece of the pie to get you that 6% to 25% return. It really makes a huge difference.

Today’s market is super competitive. Staged homes have a big advantage with buyers, and not staging your home could mean having it sit on the market for a long period of time.&nbsp;

Decluttering, depersonalizing, and organizing are all things that Rachael believes every seller should do even before they hire a professional stager.

If you’re interested in getting contact with Rachael, she serves the area between Sweet Home and Philoma. You can reach out to her by giving her a call at (541) 905-2189 or sending her an email to [FinalTouchesStaging@gmail.com](mailto:FinalTouchesStaging@gmail.com ).

If you have any other questions for me or my team in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send mean mail. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
