If you’ve ever submitted a high offer on a home and still lost, you may be confused as to how it happened. After all, sellers simply look at the biggest dollar amount when choosing an offer, right? Well, that’s quite often not the case. **In fact, there are six reasons why the highest offer doesn’t necessarily mean a winning one:**

**1. Not being flexible.** Sellers look at terms that are specific to their own situation. Maybe they need more than 30 days to move out, but your offer requires them to vacate within a couple weeks.&nbsp;

**2. Paperwork isn’t squared away.** I always talk to my buyers about the importance of having pre-approval letters completed. You’ll be out shopping and looking at homes, but you haven’t submitted everything the bank needs ahead of time. This prevents you from submitting an offer altogether. If you’re paying cash, get a letter from your bank or financial advisor that proves you have the funds.

**3. Having too many contingencies.** You may be putting in a high offer, but if you’re asking for thousands of dollars in concessions, it lowers the bottom line for the seller.

**4.Asking for too many things to be included.** Perhaps the house has some great family heirlooms you would like—wait until after your offer is accepted to negotiate these items.

**5. Not expressing love for the house.** Think about writing a letter or shooting a video that introduces yourself to the sellers. Tell them who you are, who your family is, and so on. Remember, the sellers may be walking away from something very sentimental—they likely want it to be left in good hands.

**6. Giving up after your offer wasn’t accepted.** We saw this last summer when the best offers would fall off after a few weeks. If you wait, there’s a chance you could later be placed in the No. 1 spot.&nbsp;
