If you’ve got pets of your own, here are a few things to think about when buying a home:

**1. Check city and state laws** regarding any kind of breed restrictions they have, as well as limits on the number of animals that you can have in your home with you.

**2. Does the home have pet-friendly floors?** Hardwood, linoleum, and other similarly slick flooring types can make it hard for furry paws to get a grip. However, pet claws can damage carpets, and that’s not to mention all the shed fur and dander—wood floors, in general, are the way to go.

**3. Is the home accessible to elderly pets?** Older dogs and cats might find it hard to make it up and down stairs, so a single-level home might be a better choice for them.

**4. Is the neighborhood safe for pets?** Our four-legged friends need lots of room to run and play, so consider checking out the area you’re interested in buying to see if there are parks or trails to take the whole family for walks.

We all want the best for the animals in our lives, so these are just a few points to consider when you’re making a move to a new home. Pay attention to these points, and I’m sure both you and your fur-ever friends will be all the happier.
