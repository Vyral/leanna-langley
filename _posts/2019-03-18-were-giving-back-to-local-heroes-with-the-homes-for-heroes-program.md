Recently, I had the privilege of speaking with Kristina Hubbard from Pacific Residential Mortgage about an amazing program for select individuals in our community: Homes for Heroes.&nbsp;

**This program is designed to help first responders, individuals in the medical field, police, firefighters, teachers, and veterans buy or sell with ease by offering grants,** called “Hero Rewards,” at the closing table. One such reward is the $500 gift offered to buyers at closing to help offset any expenses related to the deal.&nbsp;

Better yet, when qualified individuals partner with an affiliate brokerage, title company, or vendor, they have the opportunity to earn an even better deal. When you work with Cadwell Realty on your home purchase, for example, you’ll receive an additional check in the mail after closing. The amount of this check will equal $700 for every $100,000 on the total purchase price, which is an amazing deal.

Sellers, too, can benefit from this great program. **Those who list using this program will receive a 25% credit of gross commission at closing.&nbsp;**

Of course, as we mentioned earlier, only certain agents and lenders are affiliated with Homes for Heroes—only professionals who have been thoroughly vetted can offer this program.&nbsp;

If you’d like to learn more about this program, feel free to contact Kristina by phone at&nbsp;<br>(541) 791 -2612 or email [team.hubbard@pacresmortgage.com](mailto:team.hubbard@pacresmortgage.com).&nbsp;
