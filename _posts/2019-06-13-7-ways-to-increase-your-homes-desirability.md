The peak selling season is finally here, and everyone has begun to put their homes on the market. We’ve seen a lot of homes for sale, and buyers’ expectations are (understandably) high. Here are a few tips that will help your home shine in buyers’ critical eyes:

**1\. Assess your home’s condition.** Look at your home through a buyer’s eyes:Walk through the inside and outside of a home and look for anything that might turn a buyer off.<br><br>**2\. Get rid of oversized furniture.** &nbsp;That huge sectional may be comfortable, but it’s really just taking up space. Move it and any other furniture that blocks the walkways in your home to storage.<br><br>**3\. Remove clutter and depersonalize.** Put away the trophies, family photos, and other such personal items. You want the buyers to be able to clearly imagine themselves living in your home, instead of making them feel like they’re kicking you out of your home.<br><br>**4\. Deep clean the home.** Hire a professional service, or else invite your friends and family over to do a thorough sweep of the home—and don’t forget the outside, too\!<br><br>**5\. Work on curb appeal.** Our area has some great plant nurseries where you can buy hanging baskets and decorative pots to plant flowers that will give your yard a splash of color that’s sure to catch buyers’ eyes.<br><br>**6\. Repaint using neutral colors.** A bright red kitchen might be fun for you, but if you’re planning to sell your home, know that buyers will truly appreciate a neutral palette in your home a lot more than flashy, fun colors.<br><br>**7\. Get professional photos taken.** Whenever you list a home with me, I pay for a professional photographer to take photos of your listing. Depending on the size of your home, we might also make a video for those buyers coming from out of state. In fact, Zillow reports show that more and more people are skipping straight to a listing’s video instead of browsing through the photos.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about selling your home in this summer market, feel free to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
