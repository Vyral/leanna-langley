Today I’m delighted to be joined by Josh Kittel from OPES Advisors to talk a little bit about reverse mortgages, how they work, and some common misconceptions about them.

**If you’re 62 years or older and own a home, you’re eligible for a reverse mortgage.** According to Josh, there’s a lot of confusion about how this program works. However, it can be very helpful and beneficial to those in a situation where they’re equity rich, but cash poor.

**The decision on whether to get a reverse mortgage starts with an honest conversation about what your goals are, what your attachment is to your property, and where you’re at financially.** It’s important to talk with both spouses, as well as your children and financial advisor. Once you decide to move forward, you’ll also need to take a class before you can finally apply for the reverse mortgage.

**You can use a reverse mortgage for both the purchase of a new property or a refinance of your current property.** There are several different ways that you can structure that. Based on the age of the youngest borrower in the house, you may or may not need as much of an equity position to make this type of loan work. That’s a key factor in determining how much equity must remain in the property at the time of funding.
