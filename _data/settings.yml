  about_markdown: |
    I have been selling real estate in the Willamette Valley since 2007. Since then I have seen several changes in the market and have navigated many clients through their most important purchase or sale of their lives. Buying a home is a journey that you will want an experienced agent to guide you and I would be honored to be that person. My specialties are residential whether it be an upscale home in the suburbs to a home sitting on several acres in the country, you can rest assured I have the knowledge to assist. The bulk of my business has been built on referral and I take pride in being a trusted advisor to my clients. If you need help in this ever changing real estate market feel free to contact me via text, email, or a phone call. When I am not selling real estate my favorite things include traveling, hiking around Oregon & Montana, or just relaxing in the backyard with a book!
